    "text": "In this section, you’ll learn how to make a variety of plots in R using ggplot2, including some that aren’t possible (or are painful!) in Excel. We’ll continue to use the delaney_processed.csv dataset to explore the distributions and relationships between molecular properties and solubility.\n\nHistograms\n\nA basic histogram\nA histogram shows the shape of a continuous variable, perfect for variables like solubility, molecular weight, polar surface area, etc.\nLet’s start by plotting a basic histogram:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe line:\ngeom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, fill = \"steelblue\", colour = \"white\")\nadds a histogram layer to the ggplot. Each argument controls a different aspects of how the histogram looks:\n\ngeom_histogram(...) tells ggplot to araw a histogram of the variable mapped inside aes().\nbinwidth = 0.5 sets how wide each bar (“bin”) should be. A smaller binwidth produces more bars hence more detail but equally, more noise. A larger binwidth, on the other hand, is smoother but less detailed.\nfill = \"steelblue\" sets the inside colour of each bar. There are a LOT (!) of named colours in R (at last count, 655… you can see the whole list by typing colours() in the Console). The command fill also takes both rgb() and hex code inputs (if you’re not sure of the name!).\ncolour = \"white\" sets the outline colour of the bars.\n\nTry changing the colour of the bars to yellowgreen or orchid and see what happens.\n\n\nPlotting a histogram with a density curve\nYou may want to plot both the bars of a histogram and a smooth curve showing the distribution. Try the command below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two key differences between the code here and that of earlier:\n\naes(y = after_stat(density)), which scales the histogram so that the total area under the curve is equal to 1 rather than the frequency count.\ngeom_density() adds the density curve on top.\n\n\n\nPlotting a histogram with a rug plot\nA rug is simply a tick mark (“rug”). A rug plot therefore shows tick marks for each individual datapoint along the axis. By defaut, the rug is plotted along the x-axis at the bottom of the plot. Try adding a call to geom_rug() to the end of the command below to add the rug!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should add: + geom_rug() to the end of the command to add another layer, which, in this case is the rug.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = `measured log solubility in mols per litre`)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, fill = \"steelblue\", colour = \"white\") + geom_rug()\nggplot(data, aes(x = `measured log solubility in mols per litre`)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, fill = \"steelblue\", colour = \"white\") + geom_rug()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoxplots\n\nA basic boxplot\nBoxplots are excellent for summarising distributions and spotting outliers. A default boxplot in R follows the standard Tukey format i.e. it shows the middle 50% of the data inside the box (from the 25th to 75th percentile), with a line marking the median. The “whiskers” extend to the largest and smallest values that aren’t extreme, and any points beyond them are outliers.\nLet’s try plotting a basic boxplot with the data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, all we’ve done is added a layer creating a boxplot using the command geom_boxplot().\nWe could take this a bit further and, by treating the number of H-bond donors as a categorical variable (since its discrete), we can use the boxplots to see if there are any trends relating the number of H-bond donors to the solubility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, the command factor() converts the numeric integers into categorical labels.\nWe can go even further and overlay the original datapoints - we’ll use the geom_jitter() command so that the datapoints are spread out a bit, to avoid overlapping! This is known as jittering.\nAdd the line:\ngeom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.5)\nto the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should add: + geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.5) to the end of the command to add another layer of jittered points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = factor(`Number of H-Bond Donors`), y = `measured log solubility in mols per litre`)) + geom_boxplot(fill = \"lightgreen\") + geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.5)\nggplot(data, aes(x = factor(`Number of H-Bond Donors`), y = `measured log solubility in mols per litre`)) + geom_boxplot(fill = \"lightgreen\") + geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry playing around with the width and alpha values to see what happens!\nIt should be noted that these types of overlays are extremely hard to do in Excel (without considerable coding etc.).\n\n\n\nViolin plots\nYou may not have heard of violin plots before but they are very exciting!! In brief, a violin plot shows the full distribution of a continuous variable by combining a boxplot with a mirrored density curve, so you can see where values are concentrated. The width of the “violin” at each point represents the density of observations, giving more detail than a standard boxplot.\nThis can be illustrated using the command below (don’t fret about the warning that will come up!):",

In this section, we’ll apply the same skills to the Delaney solubility dataset (this is actually the original ‘esol’ dataset so you may recognise it!). You’ll perform the import both in WebR (within your browser) and in RStudio (on your computer). To get started, simply select one of the buttons below:\n\nWebRRStudio\n\n\nYou’ll be using the dataset “delaney-processed.csv”. As with Worksheet 2, this is a .csv file and therefore needs to be imported using the readr package. For simplicity, this has already been installed and loaded up for you. We can therefore simply read it into a dataframe, which we are going to call data. On WebR, the delaney-processed.csv file has been saved into a folder (weirdly also) called data, so we need to ensure that we call it from that folder:\n\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"data/delaney-processed.csv\")\n\n\n\nStep 1: Firstly, check that the packages that you will need today are installed. For this worksheet, you’ll need either: (i)tidyverse (which includes both readr and ggplot2) OR readr, and ggplot2.\nYou can either install packages in RStudio by selecting the ‘Tools’ tab, then ‘Install packages…’ (as per the video below), or simply type (in Console):\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n(here, this would install the package tidyverse) remembering that you must always include inverted commas.\n\nStep 2: Open the packages, using the library command i.e.:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nStep 3: Download the delaney-processed.csv file from Canvas: CH4004 Mathematics and R Computing (scroll all the way down to the Workshops section) and take note of where you have saved it.\nStep 4: In RStudio, change the working directory to the location in which the file is saved. You can do this by clicking on the ‘Session’ tab, then ‘Set Working Directory’ and finally ‘Choose Directory…’. Watch the video below for more guidance.\n\nStep 5: Now you can read it into a dataframe, in the same way as for WebR i.e.:\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"delaney-processed.csv\")\nJust remember that you don’t need a link to a ‘data’ folder as the csv file is stored in your working directory.\n\n\n\nFrom now on, you should just be able to copy and paste any commands straight into RStudio.\n\n\nCreating a basic ggplot\nHave a good look at the data in the .csv file… there is a lot of information in it, including chemical compound names, molecular weights and their solubilities.\nWe’ll begin by plotting molecular weight against measured log solubility. This is a useful start as molecular weight is one of the simplest molecular descriptors and might (or might not!) correlate with solubility.\nSolubility (i.e. the number of moles of a compound that dissolves in one litre of water) is given here as a log value since many of the compounds are only sparingly soluble!! So… while methanol is extremely soluble, compounds such as tetradecane are practically insoluble with a solubility value of &lt; 1 \\(\\times\\) 10\\(^{-8}\\) mol/L.\n\n#| include: false\nwebr::install(\"ggplot2\")\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n\n#| setup: true\n#| exercise:\n#|  - first_ggplot\n#|  - ggplot-aes-size\n#|  - glimpse-data\n#|  - ggplot-aes-colour\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"data/delaney-processed.csv\")\n\n\n#| exercise: first_ggplot\nggplot(data, aes(x = `Molecular Weight`, y = `measured log solubility in mols per litre`)) + geom_point()\n\nUnlike standard plots, a ggplot is a way of creating plots in R using a layered grammar of graphics, where you start with a dataset and then add layers to define what’s displayed. Each layer can represent points, lines or other visual elements, and you can customise axes, colours and themes to clearly communicate your data.\nHere, the command ggplot(data, aes(...)) starts a new ggplot and tells R to use your dataset called data.\nInside the aes() (“aesthetics”) function, you specify which variables to plot:\n\nx = Molecular Weight places the compounds’ molecular weight (where the column is called Molecular Weight) on the horizontal axis.\ny = measured log solubility in mols per litre places the measured log solubility on the vertical axis.\n\nThe plus symbol, + is used in ggplot to “add layers”. Each new layer modifies or enhances the plot.\ngeom_point() adds a layer of points to create a scatter plot, which is commonly used to examine relationships between two continuous variables. In this case, it allows us to explore whether molecular weight appears to influence solubility. From the graph that you’ve just made, we can clearly see that it does!\n\n\nExploring your data\nYou’ve already made a basic scatter plot of molecular weight vs. measured solubility. Now it’s time to experiment with mapping other variables to visual features.\nLet’s try adding extra features to this plot. The scatter points can (excitingly!) be mapped to other properties - so, as an example, the size of the points can be related to e.g. the number of hydrogen bond donors of the compound. The act of connecting a data variable to a visual property in this way is called aesthetic mapping.\nAt this point, it will be worthwhile having a look at the data to check what the names of the columns first! The command glimpse() is perfect for this i.e..\n\n#| exercise: glimpse-data\nglimpse(data)\n\nIn order to map the size of the points to a variable, the command size needs to be included within the aes brackets. In the exercise below, replace the ... with the name of the column of data that represents the number of H bond donors in each compound. Remember to use backticks ` around your column name.\n\n#| exercise: ggplot-aes-size\nggplot(data, aes(x = `Molecular Weight`, y = `measured log solubility in mols per litre`, size = ...)) + geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relevant column is called Number of H-Bond Donors.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution (Fully worked solution). \n\n#| exercise: ggplot-aes-size\n#| solution: true\nggplot(data, aes(x = `Molecular Weight`, y = `measured log solubility in mols per litre`, size = `Number of H-Bond Donors`)) + geom_point()\n\n\n\n#| exercise: ggplot-aes-size\n#| check: true\ngradethis::grade_this_code()\n\nClearly there is some dependence of solubility on the number of hydrogen bond donors in a compound. We can try visualising this by colour instead, to see if it’s more clear… as before, replace the ... in the box below with the relevant name of the column and see what happens:\n\n#| exercise: ggplot-aes-colour\nggplot(data, aes(x = `Molecular Weight`, y = `measured log solubility in mols per litre`, colour = ...)) + geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relevant column is called Number of H-Bond Donors. Remember to include backticks around the name.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution (Fully worked solution). \n\n#| exercise: ggplot-aes-colour\n#| solution: true\nggplot(data, aes(x = `Molecular Weight`, y = `measured log solubility in mols per litre`, colour = `Number of H-Bond Donors`)) + geom_point()\n\n\n\n#| exercise: ggplot-aes-colour\n#| check: true\ngradethis::grade_this_code()\n\nThe ability to colour map (using continuous colour scales) is not possible in Excel. In fact, in R you can also do many other fantastic graphing feats that aren’t possible in Excel.\nSome other properties of the scatter points that you might want to control are:\n\nShape\nFill\nTransparency (called ‘alpha’)\nLine type (this is for line plots rather than scatter plots!)\n\nIn the command line above, try replacing colour with alpha and see what happens!!",

    "section": "Understanding R packages",
    "text": "Understanding R packages\nIf you remember from last week, packages in R are like plug-ins or apps for R. They add extra tools and features that don’t come built-in, so you can do more things easily, such as reading data files or cleaning your data.\nIn this case, as we’ll be importing and manipulating datasets today, we’ll use the readr package to import .csv files and dplyr for data manipulation.\n\nHow package installation works\nWhen working in R (e.g. R Studio), you will need to install packages using the install.packages() command. For example:\ninstall.packages(\"readr\")\ninstall.packages(\"dplyr\")\nPlease note that for the browser version these have already been installed automatically for you but you will have to install them in R Studio - simply copy and paste the code in!\nIn R Studio, you can find out which packages have been installed by looking at the ‘Packages’ tab in the bottom right pane to spot them!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nImportant notes about installing packages:\nPackage names must be in quotation marks: install.packages(\"dplyr\"). Without quotes, as shown in the example here, you’ll get an error: install.packages(dplyr).\nYou only need to install a package once on your computer (assuming that this is not using the KU environment, which wipes this!). The setup script already checked for you and only installed packages you didn’t already have.\n\n\n\n\nExercise: Loading packages\nAfter packages are installed, you need to load them to use their functions. This is done with the library() function. Slightly differently from install.packages, you don’t have to have inverted commas around the name though (it doesn’t matter whether you have them or not). For example, if you wanted to load the ‘beepr’ package (having installed it first!), you’d type:\nlibrary(bleepr)\nIn case, by the way, you’re wondering what the bleepr package is, it’s as the name suggests… a package that enables you to get an audible alert whenever your code finishes.\nAnyway, back to the task at hand! Think of the difference between using install.packages and library like downloading an app from an app Store vs opening an app. You only need to download an app once on your device (or in your R environment). However, even if the app is installed, you can’t use it until you open it. And… every time you restart your computer or your phone (or R session), you’ll need to open the app again.\nTry loading both readr and dplyr in the box below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the library() function to load packages! Package names do NOT need quotes in library. For the package readr this would look like:\nlibrary(readr)\nNow you do the same for dplyr!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteHint 2\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the library() function to load packages. Remember, package names do NOT need quotes in library().\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Again, just to reiterate, unlike installation (i.e. using install.packages), you need to load packages with library() every time you start a new R session!\n\n\nWhy Cleaning Your Data Matters in Chemistry\nIn pharmaceutical and chemical research, your data is only as good as its quality.\nWhether you’re working with:\n\nExperimental data (e.g. solubility measurements from the lab), or\n\nLiterature-mined data (e.g. scraped or compiled from journal articles or public databases),\n\n…there are often errors, inconsistencies, or missing values that need fixing before any meaningful analysis.\n\n\nCommon data problems in chemistry:\n\nMissing or incomplete values (e.g. no logS reported for some compounds)\n\nUnits or scales that don’t match (e.g. logP vs. logD, or µg/mL vs. mol/L)\n\nInconsistent naming of chemical compounds\n\nDuplicate entries in literature-mined datasets\n\nImplausible values (e.g. negative molecular weights!)\n\n\nWhy it matters:\nIf we skip the cleaning step, we risk drawing wrong conclusions — or feeding errors into models or visualisations. It’s like trying to bake a cake with the wrong ingredients.",

Your job is to fill in the blanks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTip: Use filter() to remove rows, mutate() to create or modify columns, and distinct() to remove duplicates.\n\n\nTry the code below. Fill in the blanks with the appropriate column heading name (you’ll need to remove the “____” bits first (just remember this is important that if your heading has spaces in, you’ll need to put the whole heading name between backticks i.e. `. Thebacktick ` button is often found just above the ‘tab’ button)!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember, the names of the headings are: The compound names: Compound ID The logS values: ESOL predicted log solubility in mols per litre\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Start with the original esol_data\nclean_esol &lt;- esol_data %&gt;%\n  # 1.

Remove duplicate rows\n  distinct()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Each Cleaning Step\nLet’s take a moment to understand exactly what each line of the cleaning pipeline is doing…\nclean_esol &lt;- esol_data %&gt;%\nWe’re building a data cleaning pipeline using the pipe operator (%&gt;%). This means each line takes the result from the previous step and passes it forward to the next one.\nLet’s break it down step-by-step:\n\n(a) filter(!is.na(\"  \"))\nfilter(!is.na(`ESOL predicted log solubility in mols per litre`))\n\nfilter() is used to keep only certain rows of the data.\nis.na(ESOL predicted log solubility in mols per litre) checks for missing values (NAs) in the “ESOL predicted log solubility in mols per litre” column.\n!is.na(ESOL predicted log solubility in mols per litre) means “not missing”, so this line keeps only rows where there is a value for logS.\n\n\n\n(b) mutate(compound = tolower(trimws(\"   \")))\nmutate(compound = tolower(trimws(`Compound ID`)))\n\nmutate() is used to modify or create a new column.\nInside it, we’re creating a new compound column.\ntrimws() removes leading and trailing whitespace from the compound names.\ntolower() converts all characters to lowercase.\n\nTogether, this helps standardise the formatting of compound names (e.g. fixing ” ACETAMINOPHEN ” to “acetaminophen”).\n\n\n(c) distinct()\ndistinct()\n\nThe command distinct() removes duplicate rows from the data frame.\nSometimes in real datasets, the same compound appears more than once — this helps clean that up.\nIf you want to remove duplicates only based on certain columns, you can do: distinct(compound, .keep_all = TRUE).\n\n\n\n\nFinal result\nThe cleaned dataset is now stored in a new object called clean_esol. This is what you’ll use going forward in your analysis — it’s more reliable and ready for real work!",

    "section": "Combining Datasets Using a Shared Column",
    "text": "Combining Datasets Using a Shared Column\nNow that you’ve had practice cleaning the ESOL dataset, it’s time to bring in a second dataset Lipophilicity and learn how to combine datasets in R!\nIn real-world data science, it’s often helpful to combine different datasets to create a richer picture of your information. Here, we’ll match compounds between datasets using a common column: the SMILES string, which uniquely encodes the structure of each molecule.\n\nWhat is SMILES?\nSMILES stands for Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System. It’s a compact way to represent a chemical structure using a string of text (e.g., \"CCO\" for ethanol).\nBoth the ESOL and Lipophilicity datasets contain a SMILES column (actually written in lowercase in the datasets), so even if the compounds are named differently elsewhere, we can match them using this column.\nThe Lipophilicity dataset has already been imported and cleaned into the browser, just to save you the trouble! However, if you’re working in R Studio, you will need to save and use read_csv as before to read it into a dataframe (please call it clean_lipo).\nFor the browser version, as I mentioned, the cleaned dataset is already in a dataframe called: clean_lipo. Remember, your cleaned ESOL dataset is also in a dataframe called: clean_esol.\n\n\n\nJoining Two Datasets in R\nIn R, we use the dplyr::left_join() function to combine two data frames.\nHere’s what the syntax looks like:\ncombined_data &lt;- left_join(clean_esol, clean_lipo, by = \"smiles\")\nThis line says:\n\n“Take the clean ESOL data (clean_esol)…”\n“…and add matching rows from the clean Lipophilicity data (clean_lipo)…”\n“…based on the values in the SMILES column.”\n\nThe result is a new data frame (combined_data) that contains:\n\nAll rows from clean_esol\nAny matching columns from clean_lipo, added alongside\n\n\n\nWhy might some rows not match?\nRemember, not every molecule in the ESOL dataset will be found in the Lipophilicity dataset, and that’s okay! The left_join() function keeps all of the data from the left table (clean_esol), and only fills in values from clean_lipo where it finds matching SMILES codes.\nThis means we might see NAs in the Lipophilicity columns for compounds that don’t have a match… that’s completely normal!\nTry running it yourself in the blank box below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nLook above!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncombined_data &lt;- left_join(clean_esol, clean_lipo, by = \"smiles\")\ncombined_data &lt;- left_join(clean_esol, clean_lipo, by = \"smiles\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploring Your Joined Data: combined_data\nNow that you’ve created a new data frame called combined_data, let’s take a moment to explore it and see what you’re working with. Use the head(), str() and summary() commands that we covered earlier to do this in the box below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell Done – You’ve Completed Workshop 2!\nYou’ve just worked through a full data cleaning and wrangling workflow using real chemistry datasets — that’s no small feat! Here’s a quick recap of what you accomplished:\n✅ You successfully imported messy chemical data using readr::read_csv()\n✅ You used dplyr and tidyr to clean and wrangle your data\n✅ You learned how to spot missing values, weird formatting, and duplicates\n✅ You created new variables and standardised your data\n✅ You joined two datasets using a common key (SMILES) to create a richer dataset\n✅ You explored your cleaned, combined dataset like a pro!\n\n\n\nWhat should you take away from this tutorial?\n\nCleaning data is a vital step in any data science project — messy data leads to misleading results.\nTools like filter(), mutate(), and select() give you full control over how your data is structured.\nCombining datasets can open the door to deeper analysis, comparisons, and insight — especially in fields like chemoinformatics.\n\n\n\nLicense: This tutorial is licensed under CC BY 4.0.",

    "section": "Data frames",
    "text": "Data frames\n\n1. Variables\nA variable is like a labelled container that stores a piece of information — a number, a name, a result — so that you can use it later.\nIn R, we assign values to variables using the assignment arrow &lt;-. You read this as “gets” or “is assigned”.\nTry this:\n\ndose &lt;- 50\n\nThis creates a variable called dose and gives it the value 50 (maybe it’s 50 mg of a drug).\nNow type:\n\ndose\n\n[1] 50\n\n\nR will show you what’s stored in that variable.\nTry it yourself: Create a variable called temperature and assign it a value of 37. Then print it.\n\ntemperature &lt;- 37\ntemperature\n\n[1] 37\n\n\nYou can name variables almost anything you like, but it’s good practice to use names that make sense for your data.\n\n\n\n2. Data Types\nNot all variables are the same. Some store numbers, some store words, and some just keep track of whether something is true or false.\nHere are the most common types of data in R:\n\nNumeric: numbers (e.g., concentrations, pH, temperature)\nCharacter: text or words (e.g., compound names, sample labels)\nLogical: TRUE or FALSE values (e.g., was the drug effective?)\n\nTry these examples:\n\n# Numeric\nconcentration &lt;- 25.5\n\n# Character (text)\ncompound &lt;- \"Aspirin\"\n\n# Logical (TRUE/FALSE)\neffective &lt;- TRUE\n\nYou can check the type of data using the class() function:\n\nclass(concentration)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nclass(compound)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\nclass(effective)\n\n[1] \"logical\"\n\n\nTry changing the values and rerun class() to see how R handles different inputs.\n\n\n\n3. Vectors\nA vector is a list of values, all of the same type, stored together in one object. If a variable is a single value, a vector is a series of them. This is really useful when you’re collecting data from repeated measurements.\nLet’s say you measure drug concentration over time. You could store those concentrations in a vector like this:\n\nconcentrations &lt;- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)\n\nThe c() function means “combine” — it tells R to combine these values into a single vector.\nNow print it:\n\nconcentrations\n\n[1] 10 20 30 40 50\n\n\nYou can get individual values from a vector using square brackets:\n\nconcentrations[1]   # first value\n\n[1] 10\n\nconcentrations[3]   # third value\n\n[1] 30\n\n\nTry it yourself: Create a vector of pH measurements: 6.5, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9, 7.0\n\npH_values &lt;- c(6.5, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9, 7.0)\npH_values\n\n[1] 6.5 6.7 6.8 6.9 7.0\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Data Frames\nA data frame is like a spreadsheet in R — it’s a table where each column is a variable (stored as a vector), and each row is an observation. This is the format you’ll often use to store real experimental data.\nLet’s say you’re studying how the concentration of a drug changes over time. You collect measurements at five time points. Here’s how you could store that data:\n\ndata &lt;- data.frame(\n  Time = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4),\n  Concentration = c(50, 40, 30, 20, 10)\n)\n\nTo see the full table, type:\n\nprint(data)\n\n  Time Concentration\n1    0            50\n2    1            40\n3    2            30\n4    3            20\n5    4            10\n\n\nYou should see a tidy table with two columns: Time and Concentration.\nTo access a single column of the data frame, use the $ operator:\n\ndata$Concentration\n\n[1] 50 40 30 20 10\n\n\nTo get a specific value (e.g., row 2, column 2):\n\ndata[2, 2]\n\n[1] 40\n\n\nTry it yourself: What is the concentration at time = 3 hours? (Hint: Look at row 4.)\n\n\n\nPractice Task\nLet’s try making a new data frame. Here’s a small dataset from a made-up drug trial:\n\n\n\nCompound\nDose (mg)\nEffective?\n\n\n\n\nAspirin\n100\nTRUE\n\n\nIbuprofen\n200\nFALSE\n\n\n\nCreate this in R:\n\ncompounds &lt;- data.frame(\n  Compound = c(\"Aspirin\", \"Ibuprofen\"),\n  Dose = c(100, 200),\n  Effective = c(TRUE, FALSE)\n)\n\n\nprint(compounds)\n\n   Compound Dose Effective\n1   Aspirin  100      TRUE\n2 Ibuprofen  200     FALSE\n\n\nNow try:\n\nPrinting just the Dose column\nChecking the class of the Effective column\nChanging one of the doses to a different value and printing the result again\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nIn this section, you’ve learned the basics of:\n\nVariables – how to assign and use them\nData types – numeric, character, and logical values\nVectors – how to store multiple values in a single object\nData frames – how to organise structured data in a table\n\nThese concepts will be used throughout the rest of this workshop, including in plotting and data analysis. Getting comfortable with them now will make everything else much easier later.\nIf you’ve followed along and typed the code yourself, well done… that’s the best way to learn!",

These are the kinds of operations you’ll use frequently when analysing pharmaceutical or chemical data — such as calculating averages, variability, and comparing conditions.\n\n\nAverage Drug Concentration\nLet’s start with a simple scenario: you’ve measured the concentration of a drug in the bloodstream at five different time points.\nWe want to calculate the average concentration.\n\n# Concentration measurements over time (in mg/L)\nconcentration &lt;- c(50, 40, 30, 20, 10)\n\nNow calculate the mean using the mean() function:\n\navg_conc &lt;- mean(concentration) \ncat(\"Average concentration:\", avg_conc, \"mg/L\")\n\nAverage concentration: 30 mg/L\n\n\nThe mean() function calculates the arithmetic average of the values in the vector. In case you’re wondering about the cat() function, in R it’s used to print text and values together in a readable format, all on one line, without the extra formatting that other functions (like print() or just typing a variable name) might include. In essence, cat() stands for concatenate and print!\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nWhy might it be useful to calculate the average concentration of a drug over time?\nThink about how this information might be used in:\n\nDetermining dosing intervals\nAssessing therapeutic effectiveness\nComparing different formulations or delivery methods\n\nDiscuss these points with another student.\n\n\n\nVariability: Standard Deviation\nWe can also assess how much the concentration varies across these measurements. This is where standard deviation is useful since it gives us a measure of spread or variability.\n\nsd_conc &lt;- sd(concentration) \ncat(\"Standard deviation of concentration:\", sd_conc)\n\nStandard deviation of concentration: 15.81139\n\n\nA higher standard deviation = more variability in measurements. A lower standard deviation = more consistency.\n\n\n\nTry It Yourself\nNow try entering your own concentration data and calculate the average and standard deviation.\nChange a value or two and observe how the results change.\n\n# Enter your own values here:\nyour_conc &lt;- c(52, 49, 48, 51, 50)\n\n# Calculate mean and standard deviation\nmean(your_conc) \n\n[1] 50\n\nsd(your_conc)\n\n[1] 1.581139\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nIn this section, you have:\n\nCreated a numeric vector\nCalculated the mean and standard deviation\nStarted thinking about how to interpret these in the context of pharmaceutical data\n\nThese are fundamental tools for any kind of data analysis and you’re now equipped to start using them in R.",

    "text": "Plotting Data with ggplot2\nVisualising data is one of the most important steps in any analysis. It helps you understand trends, detect problems, and communicate results clearly.\nIn pharmaceutical science, plotting concentration over time is a key part of understanding drug absorption, distribution, and elimination.\nIn this section, you’ll learn how to use the ggplot2 package to create a basic scatter plot and line graph.\n\n\nStep 1: Load the ggplot2 package\nIf this is the first time you’re using ggplot2, make sure it’s installed:\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")\nNow load the package:\n\n\n\nStep 2: Create a simple data frame\nLet’s use a small dataset showing how drug concentration changes over 5 hours:\n\n# Create a data frame with time and concentration\n\ndata &lt;- data.frame( Time = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4), Concentration = c(50, 40, 30, 20, 10) )\n\nYou can print the data frame to check it:\n\nprint(data)\n\n  Time Concentration\n1    0            50\n2    1            40\n3    2            30\n4    3            20\n5    4            10\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Plot the data\nWe’ll now create a scatter plot showing Concentration vs. Time, and then connect the points with a line to show the trend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should see a plot that shows the drug concentration decreasing over time, a common pharmacokinetic pattern.\n\n\n\nWhat’s Happening Here?\naes(x = Time, y = Concentration): tells ggplot which variables to plot.\ngeom_point(): adds points to the graph.\ngeom_line(): draws lines between the points.\nlabs(): adds a title and axis labels.\n\n\n\nTry This Yourself\n\nChange one of the concentration values and run the plot again. What happens to the shape of the curve?\nAdd more time points to the data frame.\nTry removing geom_line() — how does that change the interpretation?\nAdd a new patient or condition and compare their profiles side-by-side (optional – challenge task).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nIn this section, you’ve learned how to:\n\nCreate a data frame in R\nUse ggplot2 to plot numerical data\nLabel and customise a basic plot\n\nPlotting is one of the most powerful ways to understand your data. With ggplot2, it’s easy to build on this foundation as your analysis becomes more complex - we’ll come back to this in future workshops, as well as learning about more technical plotting tools.",

    "text": "Once you’ve made a plot, it’s important to make it clear and easy to read. In this section, we’ll learn how to add informative titles and axis labels, improve the overall look with themes, and break plots into multiple panels using faceting. These techniques help highlight patterns in the data and make your plots more professional and easier to interpret.\n\nLabels\n\nAdding and improving labels\nGood labels make plots readable and informative. Let’s take the original scatter plot that we make and change & add labels to make it a bit more clear:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe command labs() has several arguments, including:\n\ntitle which gives the plot a main title,\ncaption which is typically used to provide information about the data source,\nx for the x-axis label, and\ny the y-axis label.\n\nIn ggplot2, you can customize the size, colour, and style of labels and text using the theme() function…\n\n\n\nThemes\nThemes control the overall appearance of a plot, including background, grid lines, and text styles. Using a theme like theme_minimal() or theme_classic() can make your plots cleaner and easier to read, and you can further customize fonts, colours, and spacing to improve clarity.\nThe default theme is theme_grey() but there are several others e.g.:\n\ntheme_bw()\ntheme_linedraw()\ntheme_light()\ntheme_dark()\ntheme_minimal()\ntheme_classic()\ntheme_void()\n\nThere are also more than seventy other themes in additional packages (but don’t worry about these for now!).\nIn the example below, the theme has been changed to theme_minimal():\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it yourself! In the box below, copy the command from above and change the theme to theme_void():\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nSimply change theme_minimal() to theme_void().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = `Molecular Weight`, y = `measured log solubility in mols per litre`)) + geom_point() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Solubility vs Molecular Weight\",\n    x = \"Molecular Weight (g/mol)\",\n    y = \"Measured Log Solubility\",\n    caption = \"Data from solubility measurements\"\n  ) +\n  theme_void()\nggplot(data, aes(x = `Molecular Weight`, y = `measured log solubility in mols per litre`)) + geom_point() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Solubility vs Molecular Weight\",\n    x = \"Molecular Weight (g/mol)\",\n    y = \"Measured Log Solubility\",\n    caption = \"Data from solubility measurements\"\n  ) +\n  theme_void()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you’ve got the hang of this, try changing the theme to some of the other options, including theme_classic().\nAs mentioned earlier, we can also use theme() to change the size, colour, location etc. of the labels, as illustrated in:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s a lot more than can be done with themes… if you wish to learn more, see: ggplot2-themes.\n\n\nFaceting (panels)\nFaceting splits a plot into multiple panels based on the levels of one or more categorical variables, so you can compare patterns across groups. It’s a powerful way to show subplots side by side without overloading a single plot with too much information.\nLet’s try splitting our original scatter plot into multiple smaller panels based on the number of rings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe argument facet_wrap(~ VARIABLE) creates a grid of plots, one per level.\nIn case you’re surprised by the fact that some compounds seem to have a surprisingly large number of rings… the two points in the ‘Number of Rings = 8’ panel both correspond to digitoxin (under slightly different conditions), which has a rather complex structure:\n\n\n\nChemical structure of digitoxin\n\n\nWe can take this even further and facet by two variables… however, this dataset doesn’t really lend itself to this.\n\n\nSummary\nYou’ve learned how to explore your data using histograms, density plots, scatterplots, boxplots, and violin plots, including ways to add jittered points to reveal individual observations. You’ve also covered how to improve clarity by adding informative titles, axis labels, and legends, customizing text and themes, and using faceting to split plots into multiple panels for easier comparison.\nMany of these functions are not possible in Excel - actually, we’ve only just explored the tip of the iceberg… there’s far, far more that we can do with ggplot2.",
