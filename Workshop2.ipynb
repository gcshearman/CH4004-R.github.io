        "## Understanding R packages\n",
        "\n",
        "If you remember from last week, packages in R are like plug-ins or apps for R. They add extra tools and features that don't come built-in, so you can do more things easily, such as reading data files or cleaning your data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, as we'll be importing and manipulating datasets today, we'll use the `readr` package to import .csv files and `dplyr` for data manipulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How package installation works\n",
        "\n",
        "When working on your own computer and R, you would install packages using the `install.packages()` command. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "``` r\n",
        "install.packages(\"readr\")\n",
        "install.packages(\"dplyr\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "However, for the sakes of this tutorial, these have already been installed automatically for you. In R Studio, you can find out which packages have been installed by looking at the 'Packages' tab in the bottom right pane to spot them!\n",
        "\n",
        "**Important notes about installing packages:**\\\n",
        "Package names must be in quotation marks: `install.packages(\"dplyr\")`. Without quotes, as shown in the example here, you'll get an error: `install.packages(dplyr)`\\\n",
        "You only need to install a package once on your computer (assuming that this is not using the KU environment, which wipes this!). The setup script already checked for you and only installed packages you didn't already have.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Exercise: Loading packages\n",
        "\n",
        "After packages are installed, you need to **load** them to use their functions. This is done with the `library()` function. Slightly differently from `install.packages`, you don't have to have inverted commas around the name though (it doesn't matter whether you have them or not). For example, if you wanted to load the 'beepr' package (having installed it first!), you'd type:\n",
        "\n",
        "``` r\n",
        "library(bleepr)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In case, by the way, you're wondering what the `bleepr` package is, it's as the name suggests... a package that enables you to get an audible alert whenever your code finishes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Anyway, back to the task at hand! Think of the difference between using `install.packages` and `library` like downloading an app from an app Store vs opening an app. You only need to download an app once on your device (or in your R environment). However, even if the app is installed, you can’t use it until you open it. And... every time you restart your computer or your phone (or R session), you'll need to open the app again.\n",

        "Try loading both `readr` and `dplyr` in the box below:\n",

        "\n",
        "…there are often **errors, inconsistencies, or missing values** that need fixing before any meaningful analysis.\n",
        "\n",

        "-   **Missing or incomplete values** (e.g. no logS reported for some compounds)\\\n",
